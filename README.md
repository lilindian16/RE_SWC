## Features:

- MCU: ATtiny414 - Industrial rated
- Interrupt-driven firmware results in a smooth, user-friendly experience
- Built-in USB to UPDI serial converter for easy programming. If you want to tinker with firmware, do so
- Open source hardware and firmware. This includes all design files, BOM, firmware, etc

## Functions:

- Volume +/-
- Button short press
- Button long press
- Button double press to activate learning mode for headunit

## Compatibility:

The [Hardware Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KuhRTHHPlsPpQyRziJOaQv1jJqykjcSSAFU2pcPYcbk/edit?usp=sharing) for this project includes a compatibility matrix. As more people adopt this product, we can build a comprehensive list of compatible devices.

Most headunits supporting steering wheel control input learning/remapping should support this device.

Note: I cannot guarantee this will work with your headunit - there is a decent chance it should if I list it as compatible
